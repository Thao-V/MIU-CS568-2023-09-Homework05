# Homework 5: Hooks & Form
## Following the previous homework, you can copy the project to this directory (please do not copy node_modules since it is automatically created by running the command `npm install`)
## In the component `EmployeeList`
1. Please use a custom hook instead of useState and useEffect.
2. Implement a search function in this component. You should have a text input and a button to implement this feature. Users can enter the employee's name in the text input and then click on the button; this component only lists employees with this name.
3. Implement the show/hide button for the search feature which is hidden by default. When users click to display the search feature, the text input will be focused.
## Implement a feature to add a new employee
1. Implement a form to add the new employee to the current list of employees. Please recall that each employee includes the properties: name, phone, position, salary, and started.
2. Implement a button to show or hide this form (by default, it should be hidden).

## Please submit this homework before 10:00 PM today
